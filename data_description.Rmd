## Overview

This document describes the dataset used for the analysis of tornadoes in the U.S. The original dataset, "1950-2023_actual_tornadoes.csv," was obtained from the [NOAA Storm Prediction Center](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/). After cleaning and preprocessing, a subset of the dataset focusing on the years 2000-2023 was created to facilitate exploratory analysis.

## Original Dataset Description

The original dataset contains tornado data from 1950 to 2023 with the following variables:

| **Field** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **om**    | Tornado number. |
| **yr**    | Year of the tornado event. |
| **mo**    | Month (1-12). |
| **dy**    | Day (1-31). |
| **date**  | Date in YYYY-MM-DD format. |
| **time**  | Time in HH:MM:SS format. |
| **tz**    | Time zone of the tornado event. |
| **st**    | State abbreviation. |
| **stf**   | State FIPS code. |
| **stn**   | State number of the tornado in that year and state. |
| **mag**   | EF-scale (Enhanced Fujita scale) rating (-9 for unknown, 0-5). |
| **inj**   | Number of injuries caused by the tornado. |
| **fat**   | Number of fatalities caused by the tornado. |
| **loss**  | Property loss (in millions of dollars). |
| **closs** | Crop loss (in millions of dollars). |
| **slat**  | Starting latitude of the tornado. |
| **slon**  | Starting longitude of the tornado. |
| **elat**  | Ending latitude of the tornado. |
| **elon**  | Ending longitude of the tornado. |
| **len**   | Length of the tornado's path (in miles). |
| **wid**   | Width of the tornado's path (in yards). |
| **ns**    | Number of states affected by the tornado (1, 2, or 3). |
| **sn**    | State number (tracks tornadoes across states). |
| **sg**    | Tornado segment number. |
| **fc**    | Estimated F-scale adjustment field. |

## Adjustments to F-scale Ratings for Unknown Records

Between 1953 and 1982, tornadoes in the database with unknown F-scale ratings (`mag = -9`) were adjusted based on property loss and path length. The methodology is as follows:

1. **Property Loss Criteria**:
   - F-scale ratings were determined using property loss as the primary factor. Loss thresholds ranged from <$50 (F0) to <$5B (F4).
2. **Path Length Adjustments**:
   - Tornadoes with path lengths >5 miles received an upward adjustment of +1 to their F-scale rating.
   - Tornadoes with path lengths â‰¤5 miles received a downward adjustment of -1 (except for F0, which remained unchanged).

### Distribution of Adjusted F-scale Ratings:
- F0: 1,038 tornadoes (55.5%)
- F1: 742 tornadoes (40.1%)
- F2: 26 tornadoes (1.3%)
- F3: 52 tornadoes (2.7%)
- F4: 6 tornadoes (0.3%)
- F5: None

These adjustments are indicated by the `fc` field:
- `fc = 0`: Original F-scale rating was retained.
- `fc = 1`: F-scale rating was modified from -9 based on property loss and path length.

This methodology ensures more accurate representation of tornado severity in the dataset.

## Data Cleaning and Edits

To focus on recent tornado events and ensure analysis-ready data, the following steps were performed:

1. **Filtering**:
   - Only tornado events from the year 2000 onward (`yr >= 2000`) were retained.
2. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**:
   - The following columns were removed:
     - `tz` (time zone)
     - `stf` (state FIPS code)
     - `ns` (number of states affected)
     - `sn` (state number for tornado tracking)
     - `sg` (tornado segment number)
     - `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4` (legacy F-scale columns).
3. **Relocating Columns**:
   - The `fc` column was moved to immediately follow the `mag` column for clarity.
4. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Rows with missing values in any column were dropped.

The cleaned dataset contains 29,507 rows and 20 columns, with no missing values.


## Summary

The cleaned dataset is a subset of the original dataset focusing on tornado events between 2000 and 2023. It includes critical information on tornado characteristics, geographic data, and impacts (injuries, fatalities, and losses). Additionally, historical F-scale adjustments provide a more accurate severity rating for older records. This refined dataset is used for exploratory data analysis and modeling to uncover patterns and trends in tornado impacts across the U.S.
